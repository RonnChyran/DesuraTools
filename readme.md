==============
DesuraTools is a easy to use utility to help manage your Desura Library

Usage
-----
Simply run `desuratools.exe`. Ensure the `imageformats` folder containing dll libraries is in the same folder as `desuratools.exe`

[Desura](http://desura.com) must be installed for DesuraTools to work correctly. [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) must be instaled to be able to add games to Steam as a "Non-Steam Game"

Input your Desura username and press "Load Games". Ensure the correct Steam ID is selected. DesuraTools will automatically save your settings.
Note: **Private Desura profiles are unsupported. A Steam account must have been logged on at least once on your computer for it to show in the list**

You can select multiple games using CTRL, or the "Select All" button. Right-click on a game, or multipe games, for more options. 

Features
--------
  * Install/Uninstall/Verify multiple Desura games at once
  * Easily add your Desura games to your Steam library

Building
--------
Ensure that PyInstaller, PIL, PySide, Qt4.8, and pywin32 are installed. Simply run build_win.py to build the program.

Porting
-------
DesuraTools has been designed so that porting to OSX or Linux is extremely easy. Unfortunatley, I do not own an OSX or Linux machine, so I can not port the program myself. If you are interested, please feel free to fork DesuraTools.
